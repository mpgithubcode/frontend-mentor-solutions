## My process

I started with just positioning the elements on the page. I have gotten pretty comfortable with working with divs and the flexbox. I then formatted each of the elements according to the desktop workflow.

I am starting to also optimize the CSS first try and grouping things together in a logical way

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

how to put lines and line breaks into the css code
I should use the mobile first workflow
furthering my understanding of the flexbox and positioning

### Continued development

- I still have to incorporate hover states
- optimize the mobile view
