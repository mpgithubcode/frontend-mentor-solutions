## Overview

### The challenge

Once again, is started with the parent elements and worked my to the children. This time I was able to center and style things a little bit faster than last time. I felt more confident during this project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
1. Text decoration properties
  - using text decorations to add strikethrough to the price

2. Overflow hidden
  - allow the container to close into the content

3. fill content (images) to div
  - using ```height: 100vh;``` to fill the container and then setting width to author

### Continued development

Things I still have to add
  - shadow around the box
  - transparency for the background
  - resizing elements
  - media query for mobile
